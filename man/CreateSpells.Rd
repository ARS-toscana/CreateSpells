\item{category}{(optional) categorical variable}

\item{category_is_numeric}{(optional) default FALSE. If  TRUE, the variable category is integer.}

\item{replace_missing_end_date:}{(optional). When specified, it contains a date to replace end_date when it is missing.}

\item{overlap:}{(optional) default FALSE. If TRUE, overlaps of pairs of categories are processed as well.}

\item{dataset_overlap:}{(optional) if overlap TRUE, the name of the file containing the overlap dataset

\description{
CreateSpells takes as input a dataset with multiple time windows per unit of observation. Multiple categories of time windows may be recorded per unit, and time windows of the same unit may overlap, even within the same category. The purpose of the function is creating a dataset where the time windows of the each person and category are disjoint (a time window which is disjoint form the others is called spell). Additionally, a category  '_overall' is added, where time windows are processed regardless of their category. As an option, overlap of pairs of categories are also processed: each pair will be associated to spells where both values are recorded.
