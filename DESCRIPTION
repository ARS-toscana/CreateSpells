Title: Create Spells from Observation Periods
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    person("Davide", "Messina", , "davide.messina@ars.toscana.it", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: CreateSpells takes as input a dataset with multiple time
    windows per unit of observation.  Multiple categories of time windows
    may be recorded per unit, and time windows of the same unit may
    overlap, even within the same category.  The purpose of the function
    is creating a dataset where the time windows of the each person and
    category are disjoint (a time window which is disjoint form the others
    is called spell).  Additionally, a category '_overall' is added, where
    time windows are processed regardless of their category.  As an
    option, overlap of pairs of categories are also processed: each pair
    will be associated to spells where both values are recorded.
