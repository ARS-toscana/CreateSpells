Title: Create Spells from Observation Periods
Version: 0.1.0
Author: ARS
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: CreateSpells takes as input a dataset with multiple time windows per unit of observation.
  Multiple categories of time windows may be recorded per unit, and time windows of the same unit may overlap,
  even within the same category.
  The purpose of the function is creating a dataset where the time windows of the each person and category are disjoint
  (a time window which is disjoint form the others is called spell).
  Additionally, a category  '_overall' is added, where time windows are processed regardless of their category.
  As an option, overlap of pairs of categories are also processed: each pair will be associated to spells where both values are recorded.
